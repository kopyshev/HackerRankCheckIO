### The Devil's WiFi

The devil tells the newly arrived programmer the 8 digits of the sequence, and the previous 8 digits of the sequence he must calculate from the number pi.
So, you are given the task to calculate the WiFi password in Hell from an arbitrary 8-digit sequence of digits.
For example, the given sequence is __28638823__.
You need to find this sequence and the previous 8 digits __73115956__, which will be the WiFi password.
