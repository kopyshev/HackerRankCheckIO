### The Devil's WiFi

The devil tells the newly arrived programmer the 8 digits of the sequence, and the previous 8 digits of the sequence he must calculate from the number pi.

So, you are given the task to calculate the WiFi password in hell from an arbitrary 8-digit sequence of digits.
For example, the given sequence is 28638823.
You need to find this sequence and the previous 8 digits 73115956, which will be the WiFi password.
